Entity is a community based distributor of a Roblox vehicle chassis system for self propelled land vehicles only. Established in 2,024, Entity's goal is to support many different vehicle types and be highly extensible and configurable. This project is open to contributions and will merge with other forks if an improvement is found. Entity is a continuation of A-Chassis 6C Version 1.51 and 1.5, 0.50 is forked from an A-Chassis 1.6 prototype build from June 2,023. 

Entity's philosophy is:

- Much like an emulator, try to make recreating as much vehicle types as possible work as best as possible.

- Make the tuner's life easier.

- Focus on realism.

- Focus on configurability.

- Optimize as much as possible.

- Help plugins interconnect.

- Respect how the user's avatar is set up by roblox.

# Optimal Game Settings

RA will not try to impose it's own baked in physics into your game, as a result however you are responsible for setting the game gravity to something realistic to prevent suspension crush. More dynamic suspension is sensitive to the extremely high default gravity so use the following settings.

57.75 Gravity in the WorkSpace (you will have to compensate the jump settings once you change the gravity, for realism set to 0.7m)

Set road friction to 2 (the maximum) (ignore other materials like sand and grass.)

# Installation
For the Roblox version just add the model to your inventory and open your inventory and insert the model.

For the GitHub version download the `.rbxm` file and drag and drop or right click and choose "Insert" and choose "Insert from File" and select the file.
Using a `.rbxmx` file to update the master repository is recommended because the differences can be immediately seen on GitHub as it shows everything from parts to code changed. `.rbxmx` files are "Source" versions of `.rbxm` while `.rbxm` files are the packed but unreadable versions. Simply pick "Roblox XML Model Files" in the dropdown file type menu when saving an RBXM. You can still add an RBXM version to the releases.

Please set the position of the chassis to 0 in the properties by erasing everything and typing 0. This will avoid position differences when comparing the RBXMX files with the fork's and the file size.
