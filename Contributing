# Contributing / Forking
Create a fork and update the repository then go to the main project and create a pull request on the testing branch. If i like the changes and want to add it i will accept the pull request, if i don't then you can always keep your fork and work on it. If i do accept your request your changes will be in the next main release if they aren't a bug, if it's something urgent i will push it out and if it's a minor cleanup  i will defer it to the next bug fix or next main release.

Using a `.rbxmx` file to update the testing repository is recommended because the differences can be immediately seen on GitHub as it shows everything from parts to code changed. `.rbxmx` files are "Source" versions of `.rbxm` while `.rbxm` files are the packed but unreadable versions. Simply pick "Roblox XML Model Files" in the dropdown file type menu when saving an RBXM. You can still add an RBXM version to the releases.

Please set the position of the chassis to 0 in the properties by erasing everything and typing 0. This will avoid position differences when comparing the RBXMX files with the fork's and the file size.
